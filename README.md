## Project Overview

I previously developed this project using Vanilla JavaScript, but in this version, I rebuilt it with React to make it more **modular**, **dynamic**, and **user-focused**.  
Users can add dessert items to their cart, adjust quantities, and confirm their orders to start a new shopping session.

## Features

### Add to Cart & Quantity Management
- When the same item is added again, its quantity is automatically increased.
- If the quantity is reduced to zero, the item is automatically removed from the cart.

### Dynamic Total Price & Item Count
- The total price of all items in the cart is **automatically calculated**.
- Both the item count and the total price update in real-time as the user interacts with the cart.

### Item Removal & Clear All
- Users can remove items individually or use the “Clear All” button to empty the entire cart.
- Upon clearing, the cart resets and the user is notified.

### Order Confirmation & New Order Flow
- When the order is confirmed, a modal window is displayed:  
  “Order Confirmed – We hope you enjoy your food!”  
- Clicking the “Start New Order” button resets the cart and begins a new session.

## Design & User Experience

- Built with a **mobile-first** approach.
- Fully responsive across both mobile and desktop devices.
- Hover animations, modal transitions, and per-letter animated titles were added to enhance user experience.

## What I Learned

- State management with React (`useState`)
- Component communication via props
- Rendering lists dynamically using `map`
- Applying CSS animations (fade-in, scale-in-out, underline hover effects)
- Implementing modals, toast notifications, and responsive layout techniques in React
